N people are standing in circle and play following game: they start with the first person, count K people clockwise, then the K+1-th person leaves the circle and the process starts all over, using the person clockwise of the last person removed as the starting point.

For example when N = 9 and K = 3 people would leave in following order: 4, 8, 3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 2

Given N and K, find who wins the game if counting starts with person 1. Person indices are 1-based.

The last person who is left is declared the winner.

Input
The input consists of a single integer T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T pairs of numbers N and K, all separated by whitespace.

Output
Print T whitespace-separated integers, the indices for each test case of the winner of the game.

Constraints
T = 20
1 ≤ N ≤ 1012
1 ≤ K ≤ 104

Example Input:
5
9 3
4 1
3 2
5 4
6 9

Example Output:
1
1
2
