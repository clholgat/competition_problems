Recall the definition of the Fibonacci sequence:
f_1 = 1
f_2 = 2
f_n = f_{n-1}+f_{n-1} for n >= 3

Given two numbers a,b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range [a, b]

Input:
The first line of the input will be one integer indicating the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of one line with two integers A and B, A <= B <= 10^100.

Output:
For each test case output on a single line, the number of Fibonacci numbers f_1 with a <= f_i <= b.

Sample Input:
2
10 100
1234567890 9876543210

Sample Output:
5
4
